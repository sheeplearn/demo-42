# demo-42
This is just a project
for understanding
how github works.  My
main concern is that 
some people will create a
fork, make edits in their
code to files that get updated,
and then not be able to grab
the latest.  Initially we will
start on the `main` branch!
Hopefully adding additional text to the 
end of the document won't cause any issues?
